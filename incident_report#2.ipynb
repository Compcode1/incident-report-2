    "#### **INTRODUCTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I work as a security analyst for a travel agency that advertises sales and promotions on the company’s website. The employees of the company regularly access the company’s sales webpage to search for vacation packages their customers might like. \n",
    "\n",
    "One afternoon, I receive an automated alert from my monitoring system indicating a problem with the web server. I attempt to visit the company’s website, but  receive a connection timeout error message in my browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use a packet sniffer to capture data packets in transit to and from the web server. I notice a large number of TCP SYN requests coming from an unfamiliar IP address. The web server appears to be overwhelmed by the volume of incoming traffic and is losing its ability to respond to the abnormally large number of SYN requests. I suspect the server is under attack by a malicious actor. \n",
    "\n",
    "I take the server offline temporarily so that the machine can recover and return to a normal operating status. I also configure the company’s firewall to block the IP address that was sending the abnormal number of SYN requests. I know that the IP blocking solution won’t last long, as an attacker can spoof other IP addresses to get around this block. I need to alert my manager about this problem quickly and discuss the next steps to stop this attacker and prevent this problem from happening again. I will need to be prepared to tell my boss about the type of attack I discovered and how it was affecting the web server and employees. (Refer to my Cybersecurity Incident Report below)\n",

    "**Section 1: Identify the Type of Attack That May Have Caused This Network Interruption**\n",
    "One potential explanation for the website's connection timeout error message is an SYN flood attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logs show that an unusually large number of SYN packets were sent to the web server from the attacker’s IP address (203.0.113.0).\n",
    "The web server struggled to keep up with the overwhelming SYN requests, as reflected in the increasing number of failed communications and error messages.\n",
    "This event could be classified as a direct denial of service (DoS) attack because it originates from a single source attempting to exhaust the web server’s resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 2: Explain How the Attack Is Causing the Website to Malfunction**\n",
    "When website visitors try to establish a connection with the web server, a three-way handshake occurs using the TCP protocol. The steps are:\n",
    "SYN (Synchronize):\n",
    "The visitor’s browser sends a SYN packet to the server to initiate the connection.\n",
    "SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge):\n",
    "The web server responds with a SYN-ACK packet, reserving resources for the connection.\n",
    "ACK (Acknowledge):\n",
    "The visitor’s browser sends an ACK packet, completing the handshake and establishing the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a malicious actor sends a large number of SYN packets all at once:\n",
    "The web server attempts to respond to each SYN request by sending SYN-ACK packets and reserving system resources for the expected ACK packets.\n",
    "The attacker does not complete the handshake by sending ACK packets, leaving the server with numerous half-open connections.\n",
    "These half-open connections consume the server's resources, eventually preventing it from responding to legitimate connection requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logs indicate:\n",
    "Initial Normal Responses:\n",
    "The server responded normally to some requests but quickly became overwhelmed by the attack traffic.\n",
    "Failed Communications:\n",
    "Legitimate visitors began receiving errors such as HTTP/1.1 504 Gateway Time-out and [RST, ACK] packets.\n",
    "Complete Failure:\n",
    "By log item 125, the server stopped responding entirely to legitimate traffic, logging only SYN requests from the attacker.\n",
    "This causes the website to malfunction as the server can no longer handle legitimate traffic, effectively denying access to legitimate users."
